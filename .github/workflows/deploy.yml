# If you have multiple workflows in the same repository, concurrency group names must be unique across workflows to avoid canceling in-progress jobs or runs from other workflows. Otherwise, any previously in-progress or pending job will be canceled, regardless of the workflow.
# To only cancel in-progress runs of the same workflow, you can use the github.workflow property to build the concurrency group:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
