title: "Cost control with spend caps"
desc: "The Pro tier has a usage quota included and a spend cap turned on by default. If you need to go beyond the inclusive limits, simply switch off your spend cap to pay for additional usage and scale seamlessly. Note that your project will run into restrictions if you have the spend cap enabled and exhaust your quota."
available: "Available for Pro plan"
