desc: "RAG stack (Retriever Augmented Generative AI) for production LLM applications. Integrating with LLMs in production needs an unprecedented optimization layer similar to Cloudflare - such as LLM routers, token compressors, token cache, guardrails, data redaction servers and structured output transformers. Arakoo is the first LLM optimization cloud built around a Kubernetes-derived programming model that enables a faster go-live than anything else out there."

  desc: "Arakoo is an open source community, supporting existing open source tools and communities wherever possible! We believe that the success of LLM & Generative AI applications in production lies in its ability to manage prompts & chain algorithms. We also understand that maintaining a business based on Generative AI is already tedious enough without having to add hardcoded prompts or vendor lock-ins in this piece of infrastructure. That's why Arakoo believes in building Open-Source Community based infrastructure (like EdgeChains)."

EdgeChains, a framework for building large-scale distributed machine learning systems. EdgeChains is built on top of JAX, and provides a number of features that make it well-suited for building distributed machine learning systems, including:

* **Automatic parallelism**: EdgeChains automatically parallelizes LLM chains & chain-of-thought tasks across CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs using the JVM.
* **Fault tolerance**: EdgeChains is designed to be fault-tolerant, and can continue to retry & backoff even if some of the requests in the system fail.
* **Scalability**: EdgeChains is designed to be scalable, and can be used to write your chain-of-thought applications on large number of APIs, prompt lengths and vector datasets.

## 🧐 Contributing Guidelines (There is only one)

This project hopes and requests for clean pull request merges. the way we merge is squash and merge. This fundamentally can only work if you **NEVER ISSUE A PULL REQUEST TWICE FROM THE SAME LOCAL BRANCH**. If you create another pull request from same local branch, then the merge will always fail.

solution is simple - **ONE BRANCH PER PULL REQUEST**. We Follow this strictly. if you have created this pull request using your master/main branch, then follow these steps to fix it:
```
# Note: Any changes not committed will be lost.
git branch newbranch      # Create a new branch, saving the desired commits
git checkout master       # checkout master, this is the place you want to go back
git reset --hard HEAD~3   # Move master back by 3 commits (Make sure you know how many commits you need to go back)
git checkout newbranch    # Go to the new branch that still has the desired commits. NOW CREATE A PULL REQUEST
```
