descriptions: Pipe, a fintech startup, has achieved tremendous success in just a year - over 3,500 customers and over $1 Billion in ARR - and all this with just 11 engineers. Helping fuel this efficiency was Pipeâ€™s decision early on to make Hasura an essential part of their technical architecture, which has provided tangible benefits to their dev processes and their bottom line.
timeline: [11 days from prototype to production, $600K USD saved annually (50% fewer devs), 90% reduction in time for new feature dev]
