descriptions: Pipe, a fintech startup, has achieved tremendous success in just a year - over 3,500 customers and over $1 Billion in ARR - and all this with just 11 engineers. Helping fuel this efficiency was Pipe’s decision early on to make Hasura an essential part of their technical architecture, which has provided tangible benefits to their dev processes and their bottom line.
timeline: [11 days from prototype to production, $600K USD saved annually (50% fewer devs), 90% reduction in time for new feature dev]
